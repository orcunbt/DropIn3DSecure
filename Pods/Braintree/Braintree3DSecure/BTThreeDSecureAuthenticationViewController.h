 @brief A view controller that authenticates a cardholder for 3D Secure

 @discussion Initialize this view controller with a BTThreeDSecureLookupResult, which contains the
 information that is needed to obtain cardholder authorization via the issuing bank's login
 within a web view for a particular card.

 You can perform the prerequisite lookup via the
 -[BTThreeDSecureDriver verifyCardWithNonce:amount:completion:] instance method.

 An initialized BTThreeDSecureViewController will challenge the user as soon as it is presented
 and cannot be reused.

 On success, the original payment method nonce is consumed, and you will receive a new payment
 method nonce. Transactions created with this nonce will be 3D Secure.

 This view controller is not always necessary to achieve a successful 3D Secure verification. Sometimes,
 the lookup will consume the original nonce and return an upgraded 3D Secure nonce directly.

 @see BTThreeDSecureDriver
 
 @remarks Do not initialize this view controller directly. Instead, use `BTThreeDSecureDriver` to initiate the 3D Secure flow.
